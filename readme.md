## Git Commands and Naming Etiquette

To clone the project

```bash

```

Create a new feature branch

```
git branch feature-loginpage
```

Switch to the new branch

```
git checkout feature-loginpage
```

Do the necessary changes on the files, add the files.

```
git add -A
```

Commit the changes

```
git commit -m "Implemented the login feature"
```

Pull the changes from the server ( not applicable for the first push )

```
git pull origin feature-loginpage
```

Push the changes to server for the first time

```
git push origin feature-loginpage
```

Once the feature is complete, merge the changes to the develop branch ( the team lead does this )

```
git checkout dev
```

```
git merge feature-loginpage
```

Make sure you pull the changes from the required repo and keep your branch updated.

- dev

origin/production is the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.

origin/staging is the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release

## Supporting branches
